# üéØ 3D Scene Building Workshop - Code First Edition

Welcome to the **3D Scene Building Challenge** for senior software engineers! Teams create amazing 3D scenes by writing **code** using Three.js primitives, then all scenes get combined into one massive virtual world.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd spendesk-threejs-workshop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser - you'll see the **Team Selector** as the main interface.

## üé® Workshop Overview - Code First Approach

### The Challenge
Teams build 3D scenes by **writing TypeScript code** using primitive shapes:
- **Boxes** (houses, buildings, walls)
- **Spheres** (balls, planets, decorations)  
- **Cylinders** (trees, pillars, towers)
- **Cones** (roofs, mountains, decorations)

### The Magic Reveal
Teams work on individual scenes in code ‚Üí **All get combined into districts of a massive virtual world!**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build Your Scene (Code First!)

### 1. Create Your Team's Scene Class
Teams write TypeScript code implementing the `TeamSceneInterface`:

```typescript
import { TeamSceneInterface, TourPoint } from '../../types/scene'
import { createBox, createSphere, COLORS } from '../../utils/primitives'

export class YourTeamScene implements TeamSceneInterface {
  readonly teamId = 'your-team-name'
  readonly teamName = 'Your Team Name' 
  readonly description = 'Your amazing scene description'
  readonly bounds = { width: 20, height: 10, depth: 15 }

  async buildScene(scene: THREE.Scene, position: THREE.Vector3) {
    // Build your 3D world with code!
    const house = createBox({
      width: 3, height: 3, depth: 2,
      position: { x: position.x, y: position.y + 1.5, z: position.z },
      color: COLORS.WOOD
    })
    scene.add(house)
  }
}
```

### 2. Preview Your Scene in Isolation
- Use the **Team Selector** to find your scene
- Click **"Preview Scene"** to test it independently
- Debug positioning and verify objects appear correctly

### 3. Navigation in Preview & Master Scene
- **Left Click + Drag**: Orbit camera around the scene
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out  
- **Tour System**: Automated camera tours through interesting points

### 4. Scene Registration
Add your scene to `src/scenes/registry.ts` to make it appear in the system

## üèóÔ∏è Building Ideas & Examples

### Village Scene
```typescript
// House (brown box + red cone roof)
createHouse({ 
  position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
  width: 2, height: 2, depth: 1.5 
})

// Tree (brown cylinder + green sphere)
createTree({ 
  position: { x: -4, y: 0, z: 0 },
  trunkHeight: 2, leavesRadius: 1.2 
})
```

### Space Station
- Silver/metal boxes for modules
- Cylinders for connecting corridors
- Small spheres for communication arrays

### Ancient Temple
- Stone-colored boxes for temple base
- Cylinders for pillars
- Cones for decorative elements

### Carnival/Fair
- Colorful cylinders for tents
- Spheres for decorations
- Various shapes for rides and booths

## üåü Workshop Modes

### Team Selector (Primary Mode)
**Code-first approach for senior engineers:**
- Browse all registered team scenes
- Preview individual scenes in isolation
- Validate scene implementations
- Access master scene directly

### Master Scene (The Big Reveal!)
**Combined world where all scenes become districts:**
- All team scenes automatically loaded and arranged
- Grand tour visits all team's tour points  
- Explores the massive virtual world created collectively

### Legacy Modes (For Demos)
- **UI Builder**: Original drag-and-drop interface (kept for demonstrations)
- **Workshop Master**: File-based scene loading (legacy approach)

## üìÅ File Formats

### Scene File Structure
```json
[
  {
    "id": "object-1",
    "type": "box",
    "name": "house-1",
    "position": { "x": 0, "y": 1.5, "z": 0 },
    "rotation": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0 },
    "scale": { "x": 2, "y": 3, "z": 1.5 },
    "color": 35653
  }
]
```

### Team Scene Format
```json
{
  "teamName": "Village Builders",
  "objects": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "description": "A peaceful village scene"
  }
}
```

## üìù Workshop Instructions for Instructors - Code First Edition

### Preparation
1. Ensure all participants can run `npm install && npm run dev`
2. Verify the Team Selector loads and shows example scenes
3. Test the Master Scene with example team scenes
4. Review the `TEAM_GUIDE.md` and template scene

### During the Workshop
1. **Demo the code-first approach** (10 min):
   - Show Team Selector interface
   - Walk through example scene code
   - Demonstrate scene preview functionality
2. **Teams code their scenes** (~2.5 hours):
   - Teams work independently implementing their scene classes
   - Help with TypeScript interface questions
   - Encourage use of scene preview for testing
3. **Grand Reveal** (10 min):
   - Open Master Scene to show all teams' work combined
   - Run the Grand Tour to visit each district
   - Celebrate the collective virtual world!

### Tips for Code-First Workshop
- **Emphasize the interface contract** - scenes must implement `TeamSceneInterface`
- **Encourage scene validation** - use the validation panel to check implementations
- **Promote tour points** - these make the grand reveal much more engaging
- **Help with positioning** - remind teams to use the `pos()` helper function
- **Take screenshots** of individual scene previews before the big reveal

## üéâ Have Fun!

The magic moment when individual scenes become districts in a shared virtual world never gets old. Enjoy building, creating, and exploring!
