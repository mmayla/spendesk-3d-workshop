# üéØ Scene Building Guide

Welcome to the **3D Scene Building Workshop**! Your mission is to create an awesome 3D scene using only primitive shapes with complete creative freedom.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Scene Folder
```bash
# Create your scene folder
mkdir src/scenes/your-scene-name
cd src/scenes/your-scene-name
```

### 2. Create Your Scene Class
Create a new file `YourSceneClass.ts` that implements the `SceneInterface`:

```typescript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { SceneInterface, TourPoint } from '../../types/scene'
import { createBox, createSphere, createCylinder, createCone, COLORS } from '../../utils/primitives'

export class YourSceneClass implements SceneInterface {
  readonly sceneId = 'your-scene-name'         // Must match folder name
  readonly sceneName = 'Your Scene Name'       // Display name
  readonly description = 'Brief description of your scene'
  
  async buildScene(scene: THREE.Scene): Promise<void> {
    // Optional: Add a ground plane for traditional earth-based scenes
    const ground = createGroundPlane({ size: 30, color: COLORS.GRASS })
    scene.add(ground)
    
    // Or for space scenes:
    // createSpaceEnvironment(scene)

    // Build your scene here!
    const house = createBox({
      width: 2, height: 3, depth: 1.5,
      position: { x: 0, y: 1.5, z: 0 },
      color: COLORS.WOOD
    })
    scene.add(house)

    // Add more objects...
  }

  // Optional: Define tour points for the grand tour
  getTourPoints?(): TourPoint[] {
    return [
      {
        name: "Scene Overview",
        description: "Welcome to our amazing scene!",
        cameraPosition: new THREE.Vector3(10, 8, 10),
        lookAtTarget: new THREE.Vector3(0, 2, 0),
        duration: 3
      }
      // Add more tour points to showcase your creation...
    ]
  }

}
```

### 3. Register Your Scene
Add your scene to the registry in `src/scenes/registry.ts`:

```typescript
import { YourSceneClass } from './your-scene-name/YourSceneClass'

export const SCENE_REGISTRY: SceneRegistryEntry[] = [
  // ... existing scenes ...
  {
    sceneClass: YourSceneClass,
    enabled: true
  }
];
```

### 4. Test Your Scene
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Navigate to the Scene Selector
- Find your scene in the list
- Click "Preview Scene" to test it in isolation

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Primitives

You have access to these shape-building functions:

### Basic Shapes

```typescript
// Box (cubes, buildings, walls)
const box = createBox({
  width: 2, height: 3, depth: 1,
  position: pos(0, 1.5, 0),
  color: COLORS.WOOD
})

// Sphere (balls, planets, decorations)
const sphere = createSphere({
  radius: 1,
  position: pos(0, 1, 0),
  color: COLORS.BLUE
})

// Cylinder (trees, pillars, towers)
const cylinder = createCylinder({
  radiusTop: 0.5, radiusBottom: 1, height: 2,
  position: pos(0, 1, 0),
  color: COLORS.STONE
})

// Cone (roofs, mountains, hats)
const cone = createCone({
  radius: 1, height: 2,
  position: pos(0, 1, 0),
  color: COLORS.RED
})
```

### Helper Functions

```typescript
// Pre-built tree
const tree = createTree({
  position: pos(-5, 0, 0),
  trunkHeight: 2,
  leavesRadius: 1.2
})

// Pre-built house
const house = createHouse({
  position: pos(0, 0, 0),
  width: 2, height: 2, depth: 1.5,
  roofColor: COLORS.RED
})
```

## üé® Color Palette

Use these predefined colors for consistency:

```typescript
// Basic Colors
COLORS.RED, COLORS.GREEN, COLORS.BLUE, COLORS.YELLOW
COLORS.ORANGE, COLORS.PURPLE, COLORS.PINK, COLORS.WHITE
COLORS.BLACK, COLORS.GRAY

// Material Colors
COLORS.WOOD, COLORS.STONE, COLORS.METAL, COLORS.GOLD
COLORS.SILVER, COLORS.GRASS, COLORS.WATER, COLORS.SAND

// Nature Colors
COLORS.TREE_TRUNK, COLORS.TREE_LEAVES, COLORS.SKY_BLUE
COLORS.SUNSET_ORANGE, COLORS.EARTH_BROWN
```

## üìê Positioning & Coordinate System

- **Origin (0, 0, 0)** is the center of your scene
- **Y-axis** points up (positive Y = higher)
- **X-axis** points right (positive X = to the right)
- **Z-axis** points toward the camera (positive Z = toward viewer)

Position objects using direct coordinate objects:

```typescript
position: { x: 0, y: 1.5, z: 0 }  // x: right/left, y: up/down, z: forward/back
```

## üé¨ Tour Points (Optional but Recommended!)

Add tour points to showcase your scene in the grand tour:

```typescript
getTourPoints(): TourPoint[] {
  return [
    {
      name: "Epic Overview",
      description: "See the whole scene from above",
      cameraPosition: new THREE.Vector3(15, 12, 15),
      lookAtTarget: new THREE.Vector3(0, 3, 0),
      duration: 4  // seconds to pause here
    },
    {
      name: "Cool Detail",
      description: "Check out this awesome detail",
      cameraPosition: new THREE.Vector3(5, 3, 5),
      lookAtTarget: new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0),
      duration: 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Environment Setup
Choose your environment - add a ground plane for traditional scenes or create space environments:
```typescript
// Traditional ground-based scene
const ground = createGroundPlane({ size: 30, color: COLORS.GRASS })

// Or space environment
createSpaceEnvironment(scene)
```

### 2. Object Positioning
- Place objects on the ground (Y = 0) or above
- Use `position: { x: 0, y: height/2, z: 0 }` to place objects on the ground
- Create your own environment with complete freedom

### 3. Performance
- Don't create too many objects (< 100 recommended)
- Use groups for complex objects
- Keep geometries simple

### 4. Naming & Organization
- Use descriptive variable names
- Group related objects
- Add comments for complex constructions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Scene Not Appearing
1. Check that your `teamId` matches your folder name exactly
2. Verify you added your scene to `registry.ts`
3. Make sure `enabled: true` in the registry

### Objects Not Visible
1. Check Y positions (objects at Y=0 might be underground)
2. Make sure objects are within reasonable range of origin
3. Use the scene preview to debug positioning

### Tour Not Working
1. Ensure `getTourPoints()` returns an array
2. Check that camera positions are reasonable distances
3. Verify lookAt targets are within your scene bounds

### Invalid Scene Error
1. Make sure all required interface properties are implemented
2. Check that `buildScene` is an async function
3. Verify your scene class implements `TeamSceneInterface`

## üéØ Workshop Timeline

### Phase 1: Planning (15 minutes)
- Decide on your scene theme

- Build objects one by one
- Test frequently in preview mode
- Add tour points

### Phase 3: Polish (30 minutes)
